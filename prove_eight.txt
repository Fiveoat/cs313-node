After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

0. Don't forget to also upload your javascript file to the assignment dropbox in I-Learn.

1. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

I believe I was able to do all the parts of the assignment. 

2. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

The coolest thing was learning the create server part of the assignment & how that comes togehter with the onRequest function to deliver differetn web pages. I have a raspberry pi & I want to turn it into a small web sever & deliver a node application & this assignment was helpful in part of making that happen. 

3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond with this assignment.

I added a couple hmtl pages that are rendered on request instead of just some json.

4. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

~ 4.5 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I had to learn a few more things than the base assignment, but I also think that others may have done more.
